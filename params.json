{"name":"Marklogic-io-test","tagline":"","body":"MarkLogic-IO-Test\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis application allows you to benchmark the write capability of your MarkLogic system. It allows you to study the relative effects of different configuration parameters. As it can be run in a deterministic fashion, you can compare the efficiency of your system to other MarkLogic systems.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the application is to allow the user insight into the write behaviour of MarkLogic in response to modification of configuration options. It allows the user to optimize those settings. It potentially allows the user to answer the question ‘How good is my system?’ by running the same tests on different systems.\r\n\r\nFull detail can be found in [MarkLogic-IO-Testing-Explained.pdf](https://github.com/mustard57/MarkLogic-IO-Test/blob/master/docs/MarkLogic-IO-Testing-Explained.pdf) which is also in the docs directory of the project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
